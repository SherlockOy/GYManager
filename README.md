GYManagerByMaven
================

NOTICE:All right, I abandon this repository because I cannot merge GYManager with GYManagerWithMaven successfully, you can help me out with this or wait until I fix this problem later or not. Before that, you can checkout the GYManangerWithMaven project here in https://github.com/SherlockOy/GYManagerByMaven to see the current version.

This is a graduation design using SSH framework built by maven and I call it GYManager. 

I made another project named GYManager with Ant but it didn't work well, so I turned to Maven and found it really convienent.

The porject is on going and as a newbie you are welcome to discuss the problems of the project with me. I would be appreciate if you have any advice.
