GYManagerByMaven
================
This is a graduation design using SSH framework built by maven and I call it GYManager. 

I made another project named GYManager with Ant but it didn't work well, so I turned to Maven and found it really convienent.

The porject is on going and as a newbie you are welcome to discuss the problems of the project with me. I would be appreciate if you have any advice.
